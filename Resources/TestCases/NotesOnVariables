I had a problem trying to assign variables to 'Begin Test' in the 'Test Set' Setting.
It appears that variable cannot be added to 'Test Setup' in the settings.

Instead of using the keyword section and explicitly entering the values there.  I have assigned two variable
that can be populated within the test itself.

I have created a variable space called SEARCHITEM in the 'Imdb.robot' file.  I have also added the 'Imdb.robot' as a
Resource to all page objects that will use the search item to enter/locate an xpath.  If this doesn't work, I will have
to go back to using it as an argument for the one page only.  I'm sure there will be a way of doing it and will need to
look further into it.
