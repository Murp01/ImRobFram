pybot -d results tests/Searchformovie.robot  - runs the SearchForMovie test file

First I wrote out test cases on Test file
Between each test case I entered the appropriate code to proceed to next step
Copied all the code including the test step names into keyword section
Deleted code from between each step of the Test Case section and deleted hashes from the front of test case name
Deleted Hashes from the test step names in keyword section

Placed each keyword into the corresponding PageObject or resource into the keyword sections
Entered Selenium 2 Library into Settings section of each page object
Added the Page object name into the Test file's Settings section, prefixed by Resource and the root location (had to add ../) to navigate there
Deleted selenium library from test file

Instead of having Begin Web Test and End Web Test in the test case itself, They can be placed in Settings as Test Set Up and Test Tear down
These can then be reused in any other tests created on the same page.
